# **Emissions greenhouse gases and pollutants**


The data are related to Tuscany and its provinces. They covered the period from 2008 to 2019 and they were updated daily.
Two tables were created: The first table contains the data relative to 27 EU countries from 2014 to 2019, the second one to 28 countries from 2008 to 2018.
In the following link you can find further information about the dataset https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/env_ac_io10_esms.htm.  

###  **Inspiration**

You can perform an exploratory data analysis of the data, working with Pandas or Numpy.
Interesting visualizations can be performed too using, for instance, Python libraries to plot the data over time or emissions by pollutant.
This dataset is very good to practice queries using SQL or Pandas using query functions.
Remember to upvote if you found the dataset useful :).

###  **Collection methodology**

The original catalogue was downloaded from [here](https://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=env_ac_io10&lang=en.) and it was divided into 2 tables according to the `geo\time' label to avoid to deal with null values.
